Hi! I’m Mario, a Peruvian student currently doing my Master’s in Embedded Systems at Polytech Grenoble. I’ve always been driven by a simple urge: to create and tweak the technology around me until it works better than before. When I’m not deep searching for a youtube video about tech, you’ll probably find me immersed in the moody, mystery-filled worlds of movies like Chungking Express or Shutter Island. I also have a huge soft spot for the simplicity of 8-bit video games—I guess I just love 'old tech' as much as the new stuff. These days, I’m also trying my hand at climbing; I’m honestly not very good at it yet, but I really enjoy the process of learning something completely new and out of my comfort zone. Ultimately, I'm just a guy trying to learn new things, experiment, and satisfy my curiosity, which grows stronger every day.
