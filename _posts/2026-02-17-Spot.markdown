**My first internship helped me a lot to understand how the professional world works; it was quite good and I had the great opportunity to work with Spot from Boston Dynamics.**

Aquai worked with the YOLOV8 model to recognize images and perform segmentation. It also used a FastSam model to train the first model with Deep Learning for tasks in high-risk factories, as it was intended to cover hazardous areas and detect faults in large metal beams.
