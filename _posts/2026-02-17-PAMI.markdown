**This is the first version of PAMI; it was the first time we worked with all the electronics on our own. We had also made a first attempt at creating a CAD program, but it wasn't very solid; we didn't know the materials well.**

The base unit consisted of an ESP32, which included a linear time-of-flight sensor indicating the distance between objects, an emergency stop button, and a voltage converter, as we used a 9V battery. This version was quite basic, but version 2 was a significant improvement with a more complex design. We managed interrupts, as well as I2C and other protocols such as UART and SPI.
