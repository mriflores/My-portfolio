**Hi, this is me, Mario, writing. I don't usually do these kinds of blogs, but it's pretty fun trying things out like writing my first blog post. Well, I don't know if it's going to be very long, but I hope it's at least interesting enough.**

For now, I'm going to explain how I've been progressing in this first part of my personal project, my portfolio. I'd never done anything like this before; it's been a new experience adapting to all of this, something I'd only heard about in web development, but had never actually tried until now. Right now, I'm more focused on learning what people call front-end development, but it's quite fun; it feels light and very user-friendly. However, everything seems to break easily, so I'm very careful that if I ever do maintenance again, I remember how to proceed smoothly and recall the important points (although when I do personal projects I'm quite careless).I'm quite glad to have started this project; it makes me reflect on how much time has passed and how much I've progressed since I left Peru a long time ago. Well, at least this is the first part.
